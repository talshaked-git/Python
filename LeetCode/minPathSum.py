# Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

# Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

# Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
# Example 2:

# Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
# Output: 12
